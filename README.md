## Installation 
 you can clone this simple budget application onto your phone by going to https://evil-fangs-05330.herokuapp.com/. This application works offline and online. 
  
 
## Usage 
 For travellers, you aren't always sure where you will have cell service. This application gives the user the opportunity to bugdet their cash offline or while connected to the mongo database (which could be configured to send secure API calls to a banking database). 
  
 
## Credits 
 I was supplied the front end by Trilogy and University of Denver, and I built the service-worker, indexedDB and webmanifest.
